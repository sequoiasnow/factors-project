<p>In order for any mission to make its way to the outer reaches of the solar system it requires a significant amount of acceleration. In the case of the New Horizons space probe this came in the form of Jupiter. Jupiter, being a massive object capable of performing orbital accelerations, was briefly shot around by the spacecraft. In this case it was stealing the rotation of Jupiter to increase its velocity, thus minimizing the travel time. In this case it was the orbital body of Jupiter which allowed the spacecraft to achieve a velocity of over 52,000mph to reach a Trans-Neptunian body. <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/26feb_grandtheft/">Grand Theft Pluto</a> Yet even then, Jupiter alone could not send such a mission all the way to pluto, thus it was our very own Earth which provided the original orbital slingshot as well as the rocket that provided the lift out of orbit.</p>

<p>New Horizons was launched on the back of a Delta V rocket, becoming the fastest spacecraft in history. In this case there are more factor of land to be considered. <a href="http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/how-did-new-horizons-get-to-pluto-so-quickly.html">How Did New Horizons Get to Pluto so Quickly?</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The land on the launch platform for the rocket</li>
<li>The airspace above the launchpad.</li>
<li>The physical area around the launchpad that was not populated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course there remain other elements of land including the primary one, plutonium. New Horizons is powered by the decay of plutonium oxide which releases electricity without a massive fission or fusion reaction. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/newhorizons.cfm">Radioisotope Power Systems</a></p>
