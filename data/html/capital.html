<h2 id="what-went-into-this-space-probe-">What went into this space probe?</h2>
<p>In the case of new horizons it was necessary to include a variety of types of instruments in order for the observation of solar planetoids. It is these which make up the primary capital of the mission for many were simply reused components from older spacecraft. I should specify, when I say reused I mean of course built from the same schematics. And of course all of these were constructed in NASA and its partnering enterprises facilities, a massive amount of capital that can not be totally recounted here. It is then the very instruments, many partially hand constructed that were the main capital of the space probe, what wen&#39;t into building these instruments you should already know.</p>
<h4 id="the-instruments-are-as-follows-">The instruments are as follows:</h4>
<h3 id="alice">Alice</h3>
<p> Developed primarily by the Southwest Research Institute, that company providing the capital in this case, this module aims at the study of Pluto&#39;s atmosphere namely its temperature and density. It consists of the following pre made elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>telescope</li>
<li>spectrograph</li>
<li>electronic detector</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ralph">Ralph</h3>
<p> Developed by Ball Aerospace Corporation, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and Southwest Research Institute the Ralph module is the main <em>camera</em> of the probe, it to consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera</li>
<li>infrared compositional mapping spectrometer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="radio-science-experiment-rex-">Radio Science Experiment (REX)</h3>
<p>Developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and Stanford University, REX aims at the study of pluto&#39;s atmosphere, doing so by sending a signal through the atmosphere to Earth and observing the deviation from a linear path caused by that atmosphere. It also measures some more standard information about the celestial bodies is contacts.</p>
<h3 id="long-range-reconnaissance-imager-lorri-">Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI)</h3>
<p>LORRI, developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, is the more specific camera of the probe its purpose being the specific imaging of the planetoid at extreme magnification.</p>
<h3 id="solar-wind-around-pluto-swap-">Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP)</h3>
<p>Developed by Southwest Research Institute, SWAP will investigate the rate of leakage of atmosphere on Pluto using that atmosphere&#39;s interaction with the solar wind to measure.</p>
<h3 id="pluto-energetic-particle-spectrometer-science-investigation-pepssi-">Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI)</h3>
<p>Developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, this module will measure the composition of Pluto&#39;s atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="venetia-burney-student-dust-counter-sdc-">Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (SDC)</h3>
<p>Developed at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder, does not aim to look at pluto, but rather the dust that surrounds it, specifically the dust of the Kuiper belt to inform more on the nature of solar dust.</p>

<p>It is notable that in all of these components the development is not often spearheaded by NASA, but is rather a joint work. By using this model of interaction, aka business model, the building of the probe can become increasingly accelerated and the probe itself more complex as each of the contracting facilities contribute to the building of components, thus contributing their own capital.</p>
<h2 id="anything-else-necessary-for-the-space-probe-">Anything else necessary for the space probe?</h2>
<p>Of course, aside from the construction of the space probe itself one has to build that which puts it into orbit, in this case a Atlas V heavy rocket. The capital of this monolith can not be computed for it was a joint project among NASA, the US, Lockheed Martin, Boing and Russia and is a object of such complexity that its components can not be classified in so brief a space. Let it then be provided that this instance of capital did exist in order to allow the functioning of the product, the New Horizons space probe.</p>
