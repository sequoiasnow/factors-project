# New Horizons mission

This website relates one of the most massive undertakings ever attempted by mankind, the sending of a space probe to the ends of our solar system, namely Pluto. It is a most unusual subject for review in economic terms, yet such are the laws of economics, if there are exceptions, than they are wrong - thus in this case they __must__ hold or be thrown out.


This mission is run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA is a government funded agency whose goal is to explore the cosmos and learn more about our planet and our universe. At its founding on October 1, 1958, it did not share the same goal as it has today. Its creation was for the purpose of national defense during the Cold War and it participated in the Space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union sent the first satellite in space, Sputnik 1, on October 4th 1957, the U.S. sent its own satellite into space called Explorer 1. Since its creation, NASA has sent people into space and to the moon, probes to venus and mars, and it has created technological advances in satellites and space exploration. NASA has had a lot of success since its creation in 1958 (http://history.nasa.gov/factsheet.htm).
