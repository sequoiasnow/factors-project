NASA is a government agency whose administrators are appointed by the president and approved by congress. The current administrator, Charlie Bolden, began his duties in 2009. The deputy administrator, Dava Newman, began her work recently in 2015 (nasa.gov/nasa-leadership). Although Charlie Bolden and Dava Newman are the highest ranked officials in NASA, neither of them can be considered the entrepreneur behind the New Horizon’s mission. The real entrepreneur for this mission is Alan Stern, the man who lobbied and pushed to fund a canceled mission to send a probe past pluto into the kuiper belt.


Stern’s interest in space began at a young age, and his curiosity in pluto sparked his effort behind making the New Horizons mission happen. In 2000 NASA had conceptualized a mission to pluto called “The Pluto Kuiper express”, but it was canceled after the NASA science chief, Ed Weiler, had decided that it called for too much funding. Instead, Weiler started a Pluto competition called discovery. This competition incentivised principle investigators from outside of NASA to plan low-budget missions to pluto. One principle Investigator who entered the competition was Stamatios Krimigis, the space department head of APL at the time. Krimigis then assigned the project to Stern. By the end of the competition, it was clear that Stern had won.


All was looking promising for the New Horizons mission until the new NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe canceled the mission by excluding the mission in the federal budget request for 2003 in february of 2002. This did not stop stern, instead he rallied planetary scientists to support the mission. Several months later in July, after Stern’s relentless lobbying, the New Horizons mission reached the top spot in the medium-size mission category in the revised report.


Then began the real work; getting the probe ready for launch before the 2006 deadline. In order to minimize the amount of time it takes for a satellite to reach pluto, they had to send it out out between 2001 and 2006 in order to reach pluto while it is relatively close to the sun in its 248 year long orbit of the sun, and to use Jupiter’s gravity as a method of “slingshotting” the probe to pluto. Finally, after years of hard work, on 13 January 2006 the New Horizons probe left earth.


Stern’s effort to keep the New Horizons mission afloat too amazing entrepreneurship. Without his efforts we wouldn’t have amazing photos of pluto and the knowledge of what lies in the outer edges of our solar system.(sciencemag.org)
