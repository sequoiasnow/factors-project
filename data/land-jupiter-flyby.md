# How Did New Horizons Make It To Pluto?

In order for any mission to make its way to the outer reaches of the solar system it requires a significant amount of acceleration. In the case of the New Horizons space probe this came in the form of Jupiter. Jupiter, being a massive object capable of performing orbital accelerations, was briefly shot around by the spacecraft. In this case it was stealing the rotation of Jupiter to increase its velocity, thus minimizing the travel time. In this case it was the orbital body of Jupiter which allowed the spacecraft to achieve a velocity of over 52,000mph to reach a Trans-Neptunian body.

New Horizons was launched on the back of a Delta V rocket, becoming the fastest spacecraft in history. In this case there are more factor of land to be considered. [How Did New Horizons Get to Pluto so Quickly?])(http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/how-did-new-horizons-get-to-pluto-so-quickly.html)
